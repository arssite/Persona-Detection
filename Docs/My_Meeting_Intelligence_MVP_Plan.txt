MY PERSONAL MVP PLAN – MEETING INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM
===============================================

Goal
----
Build a recruiter-demo-ready MVP that converts a corporate email into AI-driven meeting intelligence
using only public web data (no paid APIs), showing real system thinking and believable outputs.

Core Idea
---------
Input: Corporate email (e.g., firstname.lastname@company.com)
Output: AI-inferred persona + behavioral coaching for meetings.

This is NOT just data enrichment.
This is a pre-meeting AI coach that tells me:
- Who the person likely is
- What they likely care about
- How I should behave in the meeting

Scope (V1 – Strict MVP)
----------------------
- Corporate emails only
- No calendar integration
- No paid enrichment APIs
- Live / near-live web search + scraping
- Transparent confidence-based AI output

High-Level Flow
---------------
1. User enters corporate email
2. Backend validates email and extracts:
   - Name (best effort)
   - Company domain
3. System performs real-time public research:
   - Company website scraping (About, Blog, Careers)
   - Web search scraping (DuckDuckGo/Bing HTML)
   - LinkedIn via search-engine preview only
4. Signals are merged (company > person if person data is weak)
5. LLM converts signals into structured persona + recommendations
6. Frontend displays results with confidence label

What I Scrape (Free & Safe)
---------------------------
- Company website content
- Search engine result snippets
- Public mentions, interviews, blogs
- LinkedIn preview snippets (no login, no profile scraping)

What I Do NOT Scrape
--------------------
- Private LinkedIn data
- Authenticated platforms
- Emails or personal contact info

AI Intelligence Logic
--------------------
- If person-level data exists → use it
- If not → fall back to company-level inference
- Always phrase insights probabilistically
- Never claim certainty

Output Sections
---------------
1. Study of Person (AI-Inferred)
   - Likely role focus
   - Domain
   - Communication style

2. Suggestions for Me
   - Dress recommendation
   - Tone to use
   - Do’s and Don’ts
   - 2–3 connecting points
   - Suggested agenda focus

Tech Stack
----------
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Frontend: React
- AI: LLM (prompt-driven, structured JSON output)
- Scraping: Requests + BeautifulSoup
- Caching: In-memory (TTL)

Why This Impresses Recruiters
-----------------------------
- Works with real inputs (any corporate email)
- Uses real web data (not fake GPT answers)
- Has fallback logic (system never breaks)
- Transparent about confidence & limitations
- Shows product + engineering thinking

How I Will Demo
---------------
- Enter a real corporate email live
- Show analysis loading (real scraping)
- Display persona + coaching output
- Explain confidence and fallback logic

Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
------------------------------
- Calendar integration
- Countdown coach mode (T-30 / T-10)
- CRM integration
- Paid enrichment APIs for accuracy
- Multi-attendee meetings

One-Line Pitch
--------------
An AI-powered pre-meeting coach that turns a corporate email into actionable meeting intelligence
using public web signals and transparent AI reasoning.


""""My Idea is that suppose we have schedule a meeting we got email of that person, so with that email we search on web+ Lindein+ social media, track their footprints to paatern of that person behaviour , company details, thought process and other useful facts, hobbies, so we can know how to present or pitch something infront of him "
